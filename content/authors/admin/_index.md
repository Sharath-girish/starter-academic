I am a second year Ph.D. student in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu). I am being advised by [Prof. Abhinav Shrivastava](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/). My research interests include machine learning and computer vision. Currently my research focuses on open-world learning and model compression for various recognition tasks.
