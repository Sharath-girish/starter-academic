- First attempt to formally address blind motion deblurring for unconstrained camera configurations.

- Devised a prior that ensures the biconvexity property and admits efficient optimization

- Employing the introduced model and prior, proposed a practical DL-BMD method that achieves state-of-the art performance for current Dual lens set-up.
