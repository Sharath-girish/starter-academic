- Introduced a new problem for discovering and attributing images from real and GAN sources in an open-world setup

- Proposed a novel iterative pipeline consisting of several components such as Out Of Distribution detection, clustering and merge and refine stages providing a strong benchmark for this task.

- Analyzed the capability of our approach to discover GANs on a variety of dataset setups and also present several insights into the various stages of our pipeline.
